\section{\textbf{Experience}}

\cventry{Dec 2019 - Present}{\textbf{Senior Software Engineer}}{Liberty Mutual Insurance}{}{Boston, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Tech lead for a project to create a new cloud-native application for policy changes, used by millions of users. System was built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB using AWS CDK.
  \item Implemented project build and deployment CI/CD pipeline to deploy changes automatically to multiple AWS environments.
  \item Created application observability and monitoring framework to monitor the health and metrics of the microservices services along with dashboards using CloudWatch, Splunk and Datadog.
  \item Led project to create two new microservices for car leases and removing vehicles flows, implemented in Typescript/Node.js using Docker and nginx. Created framework to support development of multiple new microservices.
  \item Led teamwide migration from Javascript to Typescript, evangelizing the language to other team members and external teams and leading to adoption by multiple teams.
  \item Mentored more junior team members.
 \end{itemize} }

  \cventry{Nov 2013 - Nov 2019}{\textbf{Senior Software Engineer}}{The MathWorks, Inc.}{}{Natick, MA}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Developed and implemented thermal fluid libraries in the Simscape physical modeling software. Work included the full product lifecycle from requirements through implementation, testing and documentation. The libraries have been used by leading engineering companies in their model-based design workflows. 
  \item Presented the latest features and products in modeling battery thermal management system in electric vehicles at MAB (MathWorks Advisory Board). MAB is a large group of engineering and tech companies that work closely together with MathWorks.
  \item Worked with external business industry contacts to include new functionalities including the built-in fluids properties in Simscape Fluids libraries.
\end{itemize} }

  \cventry{June 2012 - May 2013}{\textbf{Research Associate}}{PerkinElmer Health Sciences Canada, Inc.}{}{Woodbridge, ON}
{ \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
  \item Developed a computational model of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) and particle transport in mass spectrometry technology to identify the main factors in design optimization. Worked directly with the chief technology scientist and the director of R\&D.
  \item Work led to an innovative experimental initiative to develop the next-generation of spray injectors
to increase the evaporation efficiency of aerosols in mass spectrometry instruments.
  \item Prepared technical reports and presented the results in American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) conference and European Winter Conference on Plasma Spectrochemistry (EWCPS).
\end{itemize} }
